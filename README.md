# README

This repository provides the code to implement the method FedGrEM and the results in Tian et al. (2024). 

The following three code files contain the code implementing algorithm FedGrEM and other benchmark methods considered in the paper:
- alignment.R
- FedGrEM.R
- estimation_error.R

The following files contain the code for GMM and MoR simulations in the paper:
- GMM.sh and GMM.R: Gaussian mixture models
- MoR.sh and MoR.R: Mixture of regression
